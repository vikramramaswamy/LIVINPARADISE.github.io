				<p>History-laden and imposing, the recently restored 200-year-old Chowmahalla Palace is situated close to Charminar and is home to the Nizam’s personal collection of old photographs, vintage cars and antiques. Chowmahalla Palace, with literal meaning of ‘four palaces’ in Urdu language was built in the 18th century. The southern courtyard has four palaces which are Afzal Mahal, Tahniyat Mahal, Mahtab Mahal, and Aftab Mahal. Out of these, Aftab Mahal is the biggest of all, with two storeys.
 This elegant royal compound was where the successive Nizams were nominated rulers and where most royal ceremonies and meetings took place. The complex consists of two courtyards and the magnificent chandeliered Durbar or Khilwat. Another stunning construction is the Clock Tower. It houses the Khilwat Clock which still works perfectly.
